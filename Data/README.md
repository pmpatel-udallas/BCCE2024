# Sample Data

Sample data to import into Google Colab via GitHub interface.

## Gases
* Pressure: Pressure data in kPa for calibrating a sensor
* P vs V : Pressure data in kPa collected over 100 seconds collected at 20 mL down to 10 mL in 1 mL increments

## Penny Data
* Randomly generated masses and years for 10000 pennies. Plot to figure out if there is a normal distriubtion of masses
* Plot the data to confirm that pennies pre- and post-1982 have a different mass

## Engineering Example
* Engineering data based on code performance. Data is plotted on a log scale
